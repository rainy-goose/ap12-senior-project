      <h2>Connor's Proof of Mastery</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Connor Farnworth, and I am an A.P. English Literature &
           Composition student at Waukesha South High School. My Senior Project is a
            10 page research paper on how the Internet is structured, how it works, and how
            people connect to it. This website is my Proof of Mastery of this topic: I've
            designed, coded, and hosted this website on my server, all from scratch.
            The source code, as well as my commit history for this project and other
            statistics, are all accessible at <span id="keyword">

          This website is hosted on my personal server, which I bought and configured
          part by part, mostly through eBay.
