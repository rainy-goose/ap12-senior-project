      <h1>The Structure of the Internet</h1>
      <h2>Section 3: Networks</h2>
      <p>
        There are two general types of networks: <span id="keyword">public</span> and <span id="keyword">private</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div id="double-left">
<h2>Public Networks</h2>
<p>
Public networks are generally able to sustain more traffic than private networks. The primary use of a public network is to allow
many networked devices to connect to the internet. Businesses use public networks to keep their company information and inner workings
private, to ensure they are not leaving themselves open to hostile attacks.

      <div id="double-right">
<h2>Private Networks</h2>
<p>
  Private networks are usually designed to be small, but can scale up quite dramatically based on requirements.
  The primary use of a private network is to ensure security and safety between all networked devices.
  One example of a private network is the SDW network, where there is a global device <span id="keyword">whitelist</span>.
  This means that only allowed devices are permitted to access the network, and all other devices cannot connect.
