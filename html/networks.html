      <h1>The Structure of the Internet</h1>
      <h2>Section 3: Networks</h2>
      <p>
        There are two general types of networks: <span id="keyword">public</span> and <span id="keyword">private</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div id="double-left">
<h2>Public Networks</h2>
<p>
Public networks are generally able to sustain more traffic than private networks. The primary use of a public network is to allow
many networked devices to connect to the internet. One example of a public network is the SDW-Guest network. Students and
faculty alike connect their personal devices and cell phones to the network in order to gain access to the internet. However, all
traffic is monitored, and some sites are blocked. Additionally, guest networks as a whole are generally not designed to be secure.
Because most businesses or homes have private networks which contain all of their private, personal traffic, guest networks are
usually left with less security than private networks.

<h2>Private Networks</h2>
<p>
  Private networks are usually designed to be small, but can scale up quite dramatically based on requirements.
  The primary use of a private network is to ensure security and safety between all networked devices.
  One example of a private network is the SDW network, where there is a global device <span id="keyword">whitelist</span>.
  This means that only allowed devices are permitted to access the network, and all other devices cannot connect.
